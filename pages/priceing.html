                This paper focuses on advanced machine learning techniques in price and promotional strategy 
optimization at Spar Supermarket. The focus of the study is mainly on the integration of neural 
collaborative filtering and sentiment analysis to form a hybrid rating system that would increase the 
accuracy of recommended products and enhance the effectiveness of promotional targeting. 
Through this research, patterns of consumer behavior and preferences have been unraveled from 
user interaction data and customer reviews, hence more personalized recommendations.

                This paper proposed the use of deep learning through neural collaborative filtering, since it captures 
very complex relationships between users and products on which, eventually, high prediction 
accuracy will emerge as compared to traditional recommender systems. This has further been 
enhanced by a bidirectional LSTM-based sentiment analysis that refines the rating of the products 
by statuses, thus capturing the qualitative feedback from customer reviews themselves. What 
combines to make for a dynamic pricing model is the adjustment of discounts based on overall 
product ratings for the optimization of inventory management and sales performance. 
              </p>
              <p style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;  color: black; text-align: justify">
                Empirical results indicate that the proposed hybrid rating system significantly enhances customer 
                satisfaction and boosts sales. Filtering out items previously purchased, this recommends 
                mechanism will ensure new product suggestions to customers, thus keeping the relevance of 
                recommendations and encouraging the discovery of new items.
              </p>
              <p style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px;  color: black; text-align: justify">
                It thus provides valuable lessons on customer-centric marketing and data-driven decision making, 
which can transform retailer strategies. The findings provide a generalizable and flexible framework 
for retailers seeking to enhance operational efficiency and maximize revenue through optimized 
pricing and promotion strategies.

                <h5>Proposed Problem</h5>

                <p style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 16px;color: black; text-align: justify">
                    The proposed problem in this research focuses on optimizing pricing and promotion strategies for a 
                    large-scale supermarket. With a diverse customer base and an extensive range of products, the 
                    supermarket faces challenges in offering personalized promotions and dynamic pricing that reflect 
                    individual customer preferences and behavior. Traditional pricing strategies often overlook these 
                    nuances, leading to missed opportunities to boost sales and enhance customer satisfaction. 
                    Additionally, current systems are inadequate in leveraging customer sentiment and purchasing 
                    history, leaving a gap in delivering tailored promotions that truly resonate with customers. As a result, 
                    the supermarket struggles to optimize its pricing and promotion tactics, which can lead to lost 
                    revenue, unsold inventory, and weak customer engagement. To remain competitive, the supermarket 
                    requires a system that not only recommends products but also adjusts prices and discounts in real
                    time, based on individual customer preferences and sentiments.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>Proposed Solution</h5>

                <p style="font-weight: 400;font-size: 16px; color: black; text-align: justify">
                    The proposed solution involves developing a machine learning-based system that optimizes pricing 
                    and promotion strategies by analyzing customer behavior and sentiment. The system is built on two 
                    key components: a neural collaborative filtering (NCF) model and a sentiment analysis model. The 
                    NCF model uses collaborative filtering techniques to predict customer preferences based on 
                    historical data of purchases and ratings. Simultaneously, the sentiment analysis model processes 
                    customer reviews to gauge their attitudes toward specific products. These models are then 
                    integrated to generate an overall rating for each product, combining both the predicted customer 
                    preference (NCF rating) and sentiment score. The overall rating is used to recommend products and 
                    determine discount percentages, creating a personalized promotion strategy. Furthermore, the 
                    system filters out products the customer has already purchased within a certain time range, ensuring 
                    that the recommendations are fresh and relevant. This approach enhances both psychological and 
                    business outcomes by improving customer satisfaction through personalized offers while increasing 
                    the supermarket’s profitability by promoting products that align with customer interests and 
                    behavior. This research is conducted with real-world data from Spar Supermarket, ensuring the 
                    model’s applicability in a practical retail environment.

                    The methodology for "Pricing and Promotion Strategy Optimization" involves developing a 
                    recommendation system using collaborative filtering and sentiment analysis. Data from Spar 
                    Supermarket, including sales, product ratings, and customer reviews, is collected. Two machine 
                    learning models are created: a neural collaborative filtering (NCF) model to predict user-product 
                    ratings and a sentiment analysis model to analyze product reviews.

                    The NCF model, built with TensorFlow, learns the preferences of customers by analyzing past 
                    purchase data and generating predicted ratings. The sentiment analysis model, using Bidirectional 
                    LSTM, processes customer reviews to determine sentiment scores. The final product rating 
                    combines predictions from both models.

                    The system filters out products the customer has already purchased and recommends new items, 
while discounts are applied based on the final rating, optimizing both pricing and promotion 
strategies. This approach enhances customer satisfaction and business outcomes by delivering 
personalized, data-driven recommendations.
