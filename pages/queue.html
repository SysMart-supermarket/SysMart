                Optimizing consumer satisfaction and operational efficiency in
                supermarkets, especially in high traffic situations, depends
                heavily on effective queue management at cashier counters. In
                multi cashier systems, where customers frequently choose lines
                for checkout based only on the number of people waiting and
                ignore the number of products in each cart, this study tackles a
                major obstacle. Because of the inefficient queue distribution
                caused by this behavior, customers wait longer at counters with
                higher item counts and use counters with lower counts less
                frequently, which eventually detracts from the overall shopping
                experience.

                In order to improve checkout efficiency, we suggest a dynamic
                queue management system that makes use of cutting-edge
                technology like IoT devices and real-time monitoring. Our
                approach integrates a robust object detection model developed
                using the PyTorch framework and Hugging Face Transformers
                library. This method determines the length of lines and the
                contents of each cart by using CCTV footage to identify and
                categorize consumers and cashiers.
              </p>
              <p
                style="
                  font-weight: 400;

                  color: black;
                  text-align: justify;
                "
              >
                The system counts the items that are in each customer's shopping
                basket using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. It then combines
                this information with CCTV footage to calculate the best cashier
                allocation. This system distributes the checkout load more
                evenly and efficiently by dynamically allocating customers to
                cashier counters based on the number of customers and the
                complexity of their transactions.
              </p>

                  text-align: justify;
                "
              >
                The processed images, which include visual annotations of queue
                lengths and the best cashier for each customer, are uploaded to
                Firebase. As a result, the queue data may be viewed and accessed
                in real time. This technology offers a faster checkout
                procedure, which not only increases customer satisfaction
                overall but also optimizes queue management by cutting down on
                wait times.
              </p>

                The results of this research show that the application of
                dynamic queue assignment and real-time item counting has the
                potential to significantly increase both operational efficiency
                and customer happiness. This study delivers significant insights
                into and advances in retail queue management techniques,
                promoting a more efficient and customer-focused approach in
                supermarket operations by filling in the gaps in current queue
                management solutions and offering an inclusive, user-friendly
                system.

                Supermarkets aim to maintain profitability by improving customer
                happiness and operational efficiency in the current competitive
                retail scene. Queue management at cashier counters is one of the
                key operational components that shapes the entire shopping
                experience. Even with several cashier counters available,
                consumers frequently experience lengthy wait times and annoyance
                when checking out, particularly during busy times. The
                shortcomings of the existing queue management methods and the
                decision-making habits of customers are the main causes of this
                inefficiency in queue management. One of the main problems is
                that patrons usually select cashier counters based only on the
                length of the queue; they don't consider the quantity of goods
                in each customer's cart. This oversimplified method results in
                an under- or underutilized queue distribution, where certain
                cashier counters with more customers but smaller carts are
                severely delayed, while others with more customers but smaller
                carts are not used as much.

                In this proposed dynamic queue management system aims to address
                these challenges by optimizing the real-time distribution of
                customers to cashier counters. By utilizing CCTV footage to
                determine the length and state of each cashier's line and IoT
                sensors to track the number of items in clients' shopping carts,
                the system can consider both the number of consumers and the
                intricacy of their transactions. This approach is intended to
                reduce waiting times, optimize resource usage, and improve the
                general customer experience in supermarkets. The increasing need
                in the market for inclusive, user-friendly solutions that serve
                a wide range of demographics highlights the significance of
                having such a system.

                  <p style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; color: black; text-align: justify;">
                    This focuses on creating a system that uses IoT sensors to count items in customers' shopping carts in real-time. The accurate item count will be transmitted to the central queue management system, enabling it to assess transaction complexity and make informed decisions about customer distribution. This ensures that cashiers handling fewer but larger transactions are appropriately balanced with those handling more frequent, smaller transactions.

              The study employs a systematic approach to develop an optimized queue management system for 
              supermarkets, aimed at reducing lengthy waiting times at cashier counters. The methodology 
              consists of interrelated steps that include problem definition, data collection, system design, 
              implementation, and evaluation. 
              This initial step involves gathering essential data from various sources. IoT devices equipped with 
              sensors on shopping carts provide real-time item counts, while strategically placed CCTV cameras 
              monitor queue lengths. These cameras utilize computer vision techniques to analyze video feeds, 
              counting the number of customers in line. Additionally, historical transaction data, such as 
              transaction times and customer flow patterns, is collected to enhance machine learning models for 
              predicting queue dynamics.

              >
              The system integrates data from IoT devices, CCTV cameras, and machine learning algorithms. It 
              includes components for queue length monitoring, data validation, and image processing using 
              libraries like OpenCV and PIL. The queue detection model, based on Microsoft's ResNet-50 
              architecture, accurately identifies and counts customers. IoT devices transmit items count to the 
              central system, enabling real-time decisions on cashier allocation based on current shopping 
              behavior

              Trained machine learning models utilize historical and real-time data to optimize cashier 
              assignments, focusing on minimizing wait times. Input images are processed to detect cashiers and 
              customers, enabling the assignment of the optimal cashier based on queue lengths and item counts. 
              Overall, this methodology aims to enhance supermarket operations through effective queue 
              management, leading to improved customer satisfaction and efficiency.
