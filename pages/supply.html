              In this current study, a research paper is developed to propose
              an innovative approach to supply chain management, which
              involves the Random Forest Classification and Fuzzy Logic Hybrid
              Model. The suggested method intends to improve the
              decision-making process of selecting the most efficient
              suppliers by integrating the attributes of the Random Forest
              model with the features of the fuzzy logic system. The model is
              evaluated on a dataset obtained from a supermarket’s supplier
              database.

              The measurements used are precision, recall, and the f1-score.
              These also show that the improvement brought by the hybrid model
              is significant in terms of accuracy and f lexibility when
              compared with traditional machine learning techniques,
              especially when dealing with vague data. Further, this paper
              explains the implementation details of the different models, how
              to evaluate them, and their applicability in real-life supply
              chain management.

                Current supply chain research in supply chain optimization has
                mainly concerned itself with the task of finding the optimal
                supplier under ordinary conditions by the use of tools such as
                clustering and machine learning models. These approaches have
                been helpful in organizations wherein the supply chain processes
                are steady. Yet, the global COVID-19 pandemic revealed various
                concerns over conventional supply chain ecosystems since the
                suppliers and businesses found it extremely challenging to
                manage product availability and delivery effectiveness during
                this period. The pandemic made it clear that a reserving supply
                chain development approach sufficiently using widely available
                tactical disciplines is required for resilience in crisis
                situations and disruptions.

              >
                Although there are still many papers and articles acknowledging
                the current models’ imperfections and the requirement for
                crisis-adaptive solutions, few reliable supplier selection
                models are available that can address the challenges of a
                crisis. In general, most of the models are developed for
                conventional environment, and sufficiently obvious is the
                recognized shortage of information considering crisis management
                aspects as an integral part of supplier selection procedures.
                This is a good opportunity for a transition towards developing a
                more ‘robust’ or ‘dual context’ model a system that is efficient
                under ‘routine’ conditions, and which can cope better during
                crises.

              <p style="font-weight: 400; color: black; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify">
                The COVID-19 outbreak revealed major flaws in current supplier
                selection models meant for consistent market conditions.
                Traditional supply chain models, such as clustering algorithms
                and machine learning (ML) methods, centered on enhancing
                efficiency and performance by analyzing past data and regular
                patterns. Nevertheless, these models did not adjust well to the
                unpredictability and interruptions brought about by the
                pandemic, resulting in scarcities and disruptions in the supply
                chain. The main problem is that these models are unable to
                consider varying supplier performance or manage unclear,
                insufficient, or vague data in times of crisis. Consequently,
                there is a requirement for a supplier selection model that is
                more robust and can operate effectively in both routine and
                emergency scenarios.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h5>Proposed Solution</h5>

              <p style="font-weight: 400; color: black;font-size: 16px; text-align: justify">
                The solution is a hybrid model that integrates the predictive
                power of Random Forest (RF) with the f lexibility of Fuzzy Logic
                (FL). The RF model analyzes historical data to make initial
                predictions about supplier performance, while the FL system
                refines these predictions by handling uncertainty and
                qualitative factors like supplier reputation or delivery delays.
                If the RF model’s predictions are uncertain, the FL system
                applies expert-driven fuzzy rules to adjust the evaluation. This
                combination ensures accurate and reliable supplier selection
                under both routine and emergency scenarios, making supply chains
                more resilient and adaptable to disruptions.

                  Data from Spar Supermarket in Sri Lanka, covering

                  extraction calculated delivery delay for supplier ratings. The dataset was split 80:20 for training and

                  crisp inputs into fuzzy sets (e.g., low, medium, high), accommodating data uncertainties. The model 
                  used fuzzy rules based on field knowledge to infer supplier ratings, which were then defuzzified to 
                  produce a final, concrete rating for supplier performance.                </p>

                  The RF-FL hybrid model combines Random Forest and Fuzzy Logic to enhance 
                  supplier selection efficiency and interpretability. Initially, the RF model predicts supplier ratings using 
                  structured data, followed by refinement through the FL model, which applies fuzzy rules to 
                  incorporate expert knowledge and address data subtleties. This integration improves prediction 
                  accuracy while enriching decision-making attributes. The iterative refinement allows human 
                  interpretation to influence the model, making the final supplier ratings more reliable and grounded.                </p>

                    The hybrid RF-FL model's performance was assessed using precision, recall, 
F1-score, and a confusion matrix. Precision measured correct positive predictions, while recall 
evaluated the detection rate of true positives. The F1-score provided a balance between precision 
and recall. The confusion matrix highlighted prediction errors. Evaluating both the RF and RF-FL 
models showed that the hybrid approach significantly improved accuracy and F1-scores, especially 
in complex data scenarios.              </p>

                    The present RF-FL model is developed with the combination of the Random Forest model and the 
Fuzzy Logic model to improve both efficiency and understanding of the supplier selection. In the 
hybrid approach, therefore, the use of the RF model is inestimable in arriving at the initial prediction 
of the supplier rating by using the structured data. The refined forecast is thus obtained by the FL 
model which imposes fuzzy rules to capture the expert knowledge and to deal with subtleties of the 
data not handled well by the RF model alone. This sequential integration implies that the final 
supplier rating avails of the enhanced accuracy of the RF model, at the same time, endows the 
supplier decision with rich decision-making attributes that the FL model harnesses. Because of the 
iterative improvement of the supplier rating as reflected from the FL model, the refinement of the 
predictions made in the RF model is possible. This way, the proposal of new values based on fuzzy 
logic rules ‘incorporates’ human interpretation into the model, making the supplier ratings the hybrid 
model derives even more grounded and reliable.
