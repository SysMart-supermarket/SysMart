              Organizing shelves in large-scale supermarkets is a critical factor in enhancing both consumer 
              experience and operational efficiency. The placement of products directly influences customer 
              behavior, product visibility, and, ultimately, sales performance. This thesis explores the development 
              of an innovative recommendation system that optimizes shelf arrangement through reinforcement 
              learning techniques. Specifically, Q-learning and epsilon-greedy algorithms were employed to 
              construct the model. These algorithms address key challenges of exploration and exploitation, which 
              are fundamental to reinforcement learning, particularly in environments with dynamic and large
              scale datasets like supermarkets.

              Traditionally, reinforcement learning has been underutilized for large-scale datasets in retail due to 
              these challenges. However, this work demonstrates its feasibility and effectiveness by simulating the 
              supermarket environment. Through repeated learning cycles, the proposed system efficiently 
              learned and adapted optimal shelf organization strategies, which contributed to more effective 
              product placement and improved overall store performance.

              Adding a fresh perspective to the very small amount of research on reinforcement learning 
              applications in large-scale retail settings, this thesis tackles the challenges posed by dynamic 
              customer behavior and shifting product demand. The accomplishment of this research paves the 
              path for additional investigation into machine learning techniques to improve operational decision
              making in the retail industry, opening the door to more sophisticated, automated systems for shop 
              management.

              The research problem revolves around the challenges of using Q-learning in large-scale supermarket 
              inventory management systems, where the complexities of handling vast data volumes and dynamic 
              inventory operations make traditional Q-learning approaches insufficient. While Q-learning has been 
              widely applied in smaller settings, its applicability to larger supermarkets is limited by its inability to 
              efficiently scale, particularly when addressing the exploration-exploitation dilemma inherent in 
              reinforcement learning. This issue is further compounded by the need to optimize shelf organization 
              in these complex environments, making it necessary to rethink existing frameworks to better manage 
              the inventory of large supermarkets.

              <h5>Proposed Solution</h5>

              <p
                style="
                  font-weight: 400;

                  text-align: justify;
                "
              >
              The proposed solution focuses on developing a hybrid model that integrates Q-learning which can 
              handle exploration-exploitation with combining the algorithms, namely epsilon-greedy, Upper 
              Confidence Bound (UCB), and Thompson sampling. By combining these approaches, the research 
              aims to mitigate the shortcomings of traditional Q-learning and enhance decision-making in 
              dynamic, large-scale supermarket environments. A hybrid approach was tested, leading to an 
              improved recommendation system for shelf organization with a significant accuracy rate of 62%. 
              Further refinement of the model, incorporating epsilon-greedy adjustments, resulted in a 90% 
              accuracy, making it highly effective in optimizing shelf layouts while ensuring scalability and 
              robustness in handling large datasets by handling exploration and exploitation.

              This research presents a methodology for optimizing shelf organization in supermarkets using a 
hybrid Q-learning approach to tackle the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement 
learning. The study first reviews the limitations of traditional Q-learning, especially its tendency to 
get trapped in suboptimal policies when handling large datasets. It then evaluates three specific 
algorithms: epsilon-greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and Thompson sampling, which offer 
different strategies to manage exploration and exploitation.

              Epsilon-greedy predominantly exploits known information while occasionally exploring new 
              actions. UCB applies an optimistic approach when uncertain, assuming unknown actions may 
              yield higher rewards. Thompson sampling balances exploiting known strategies with exploring new 
              actions to gather more information.

                "
              >
              These algorithms were tested in a recommendation system for shelf organization, with UCB and 
              Thompson sampling reaching 49% accuracy, while epsilon-greedy achieved 5%. A hybrid model 
              combining elements from all three algorithms was then proposed, leading to an improvement, 
              reaching 62% accuracy.

            An improved hybrid model, incorporating principles from Q-learning and epsilon-greedy, further 
            refined the methodology. Through multiple iterations and testing, the hybrid model demonstrated 
            an accuracy of 90% in shelf optimization, outperforming both traditional Q-learning and individual 
            algorithms. This approach allows for better exploration of product placement possibilities, ensuring 
            efficient exploitation of learned policies. 
            The model was validated through simulations and real-world tests, showing its adaptability to 
            various shelving configurations. This research demonstrates that combining Q-learning with the 
            epsilon-greedy strategy significantly enhances decision-making in dynamic environments like 
            supermarkets.
